## Course Overview
This repository is part of a Python learning track that focuses on **procedural programming**, building on the basics of Python syntax and data types. The goal is to provide learners with practical experience in:
- Writing and organizing Python functions
- Implementing loops and conditional logic
- Using modules and packages effectively
- Debugging and testing Python programs
- Solving real-world programming problems

## Prerequisites
Before using this repository, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python (Python 101)
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Familiarity with using a terminal or command prompt

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Python-201-Procedural-Programming.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Python-201-Procedural-Programming
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

## Usage
- Open the `.py` files in your preferred code editor.
- Run the scripts using:
  ```bash
  python filename.py
  ```
- Follow the instructions in each lab or exercise to practice procedural programming concepts.
