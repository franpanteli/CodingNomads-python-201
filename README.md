# Python 201 - Procedural Programming

## Repository Overview
This repository contains my coursework for [Python 201 - Procedural Programming](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-programming-201), the second course in the [Python Web Development Career Track](https://codingnomads.com/career-track/python-web-development-learn-python-bootcamp) by [CodingNomads](https://codingnomads.com/). This was an 80-hour course, designed to help learners deepen their understanding of Python through procedural programming concepts, debugging, and API integration. This included multiple projects and labs, including SQLAlchemy, API integration, and debugging approaches.

## Concepts Covered 
The following Python skills were acquired when completing this course:
- Functions: arguments, return values, and scope 
- Advanced data types: tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries
- File input/output and managing paths effectively
- Building modules and packages 
- Dependency management, using virtual environments 
- Debugging programs using IDE features, Python PDB, web-pdb and pudb modules  
- Database integration, with SQLAlchemy
- REST API integration, with the Python `requests` package

## Prerequisites
The [CodingNomads Python 101 course](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101) was a prerequisite for this. Other prerequisites included a Python version above 3.0 to be installed, for the completion of its pdb debugger and virtual environment sections.

## Exercises & Labs
One directory was created for each module in the course, from modules two to ten. Each of these directories includes two further directories, for content and practice. Course content was presented in the form of videos and webpages. Notes were made on each of these, in a .py file per video and webpage full of content. These notes are included in each module’s `webpage_and_video_notes` directory. Labs (module exercises) were next completed. My solutions for these were annotated with comments and are published in each module’s lab folder. Links to each set of my module notes and exercise solutions are presented below. These are also found in the repository [resources]([https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-201/tree/main/labs/resources) folder.
