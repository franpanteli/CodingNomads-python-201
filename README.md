# Python 201 - Procedural Programming

## Repository Overview
This repository contains my coursework for **[Python 201 - Procedural Programming](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-programming-201)**, the second course in the **[Python Web Development Career Track](https://codingnomads.com/career-track/python-web-development-learn-python-bootcamp)** by [CodingNomads](https://codingnomads.com/). This course was designed to help learners deepen their understanding of Python through procedural programming concepts, debugging, and API integration. This included multiple projects and labs, including SQLAlchemy, API integration, and the http `requests` module.
