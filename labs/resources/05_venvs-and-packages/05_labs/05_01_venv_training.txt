Create a new folder. Inside of that folder:
1. Create a new Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv 5_01_virtual_environment_1
    -> create a new Python virtual environemt

2. Activate the virtual environment
source relative_path_of_activate_folder
    -> activate it
    -> this is like the index.html file, but the Bash file which is at the source of the project

3. Install three external packages in the virtual environment.
python3 -m pip install mypy
python3 -m pip install numpy
python3 -m pip install requests
    -> install Python packages

4. Freeze the installed packages to a `requirements.txt` file.
python -m pip freeze
cat requirements.txt
    -> see the packages which are installed in the venv (virtual environment)
    -> store them in a requirements.txt file (this was created manually)
        -> the contents of this command: python -m pip freeze, in the terminal was pasted into the reqiurements.txt file
        -> this contained the packages which were installed in the venv (virtual environment)

5. Deactivate the virtual environment.
deactivate

6. Delete the virtual environment.
This is from following the video:
    rm -rf 5_01_virtual_environment_1/
    -> the name of the folder
    -> this removed the folder which contained the venv (virtual environment)
    -> the requirements.txt file was stored outside of this
    -> the venv folder was in another folder, and in that same folder was the requirements.txt file
    -> folder > requiremenets.txt and venv

7. Create a new virtual environment.
python -m venv venv
    -> create new virtual environment
    -> venv is the name of the virtual environment, this is the name of the folder which will contain it
source venv/bin/activate
    -> activate the venv
python -m pip freeze
    -> nothing is there
    -> show the names of the modules which are installed in the venv (virtual environment)
python -m pip list
    -> nothing is there


8. Install the packages that you recorded in the `requirements.txt` file.
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    -> install the modules which the requirements.txt file contains into the new venv
python -m pip freeze
    -> the same files as in the previous directory are now there
    -> show that these modules are now installed
