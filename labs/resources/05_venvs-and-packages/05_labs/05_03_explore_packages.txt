Do an online search for interesting Python packages on PyPI.
    -> this is the Python package index

You can search for something you're interested to do with your programming
skills and add "Python package" to the search query.

- What do you find?
    -> the `amazon-python 0.0.11` package

- Create a new virtual environment and install the package.
    -> python3 -m venv Amazon
    -> source Amazon_module/bin/activate
    -> pip install amazon_python

- Check out its documentation and their "Getting Started" guide
  and code examples, if there are any.
    -> https://pypi.org/project/amazon-python/
    -> there are no code examples, or a getting started guide

- Can you get some basic functionality of the package to work locally?
    -> this is in the basic_functionality.py file in the Amazon_module virtual environment (venv)
