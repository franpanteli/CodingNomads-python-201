"""What are Python Virtual Environments webpage notes
    -> this webpage is on virtual environments
    -> VMs <- Virtual Machines
        -> virtual environments
        -> to run a different operating system on the current one
        -> virtual environments
            -> they aren't an entire operating system
            -> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A VIRTUAL MACHINE AND A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
                -> VIRTUAL MACHINES HAVE ENTIRE OPERATING SYSTEMS ON THEM
                -> a virtual environment is used to gain separation between the project and the computer which it's hosted on
            -> example
                -> we need a folder for the project and its packages
                -> there is a folder structure for this on Windows and Mac
                -> you don't have to build the virtual environment yourself (there is a command for this)
    -> summary
        -> software development is made safer by virtual environments
        -> THE PROJECT HAS ITS OWN FOLDER
        -> creating a virtual environment <- next
