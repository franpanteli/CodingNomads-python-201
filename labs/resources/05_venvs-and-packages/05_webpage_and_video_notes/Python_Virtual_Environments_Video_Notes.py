"""Python virtual environments video notes
    -> outline
        -> the importance of using a venv (virtual environment)
        -> how to create, acivate and deactivate a venv
    -> they allow you to have a separate environment for the project
        -> this avoids dependency clashes with different versions of the project
        -> make a new venv for every version of the project which you work with
    -> he creates a new directory and cd's into it
    -> then creates a new venv
        -> python3 -m venv name_of_virtual_environment
        -> venv is a module
        -> the second peice of text is the name of the venv which is being ran
        -> the termianl them shows the venv which is being ran
        -> it creates a new folder, with a large file tree
            -> there are 178 directories and 1467 files in the tree
            -> the tree can be explored
            -> these files are packages which are automatically installed
            -> they are from pipy
    -> the bin folder
        -> this contains executables
            -> which version of Python / the virtual environment will run
            -> python3 --version <- this tells you the version of Python which the venv will / is running
    -> next <- how to activate the venv which we just created
