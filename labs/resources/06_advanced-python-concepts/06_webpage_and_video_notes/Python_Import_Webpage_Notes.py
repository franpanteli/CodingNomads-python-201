"""Python Import Webpage Notes 
    -> the import statement is used to import modules 
    -> if we are working in soup.py, we can import like this: from ingredients import carrot 
        -> this gives access to a variable 
    -> Python treats the new folder as an extra namespace
        -> you can access this through the entire .py file name, or through an alias (import something as something else)
    -> you can only use (via importing) what is actually defined in the code
    -> next <- a side-effect of importing code in Python modules (.py) files which you have written (not externally imported)
