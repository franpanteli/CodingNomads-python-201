"""Python Expressions vs Python Statements Webpage Notes
    -> outline
        -> Python expressions and statements
        -> expressions and statements
    -> expressions and statements
        -> these terms are frequently used
    -> Python expresssions
        -> programming logic, which evaluates to a result
        -> for example, adding two numbers together
        -> the expression is the operation that we want to calculate
    -> Python statements
        -> EXPRESSIONS EVALUATE TO SOMETHING, AND STATEMENTS
        -> programs are made of multiple statements
        -> statements can be made of statements and other expressions
        -> an example Ã¸f this is x = 2
        -> EXPRESSIONS TELL IT TO CALCULATE SOMETHING
            -> one has an expected value, the other does not
    -> expressions and statements in a program
        -> expressions and statements are used together in a program
        -> x = 2 + 3 <- example statement with expression
            -> statement (LHS), expression (RHS)
            -> the entire thing is a statement
            -> you should research questions which you have
            -> STATEMENTS ARE USEFUL WHEN PASSING ARGUMENTS INTO FUNCTIONS
    -> summary
        -> EXPRESSIONS EVALUATE TO A RESULT, STATEMENTS DON'T
