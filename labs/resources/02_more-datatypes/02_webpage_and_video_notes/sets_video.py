        -> with sets, you can'textract the nth element like this [index n], because the elements in the set aren't in a particular order
        -> unlike with lists or tuples, mathematical set operations apply
        -> you can use a for loop on the set, and have the code read out the different elements of the set
            -> it can produce different orders when doing this, because the sets have no inherant order

            -> set operations can be used on the set
