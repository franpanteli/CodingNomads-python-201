        -> from the previous course
            -> integer numbers
            -> floats
            -> strings
        -> from this course
            -> tuple - immutabe (can't be changed, and so has no methods)
            -> list - mutable (can be changed, and so has methods)
            -> set - unordered collections of unique items
            -> dict - mutable mappings between keys and values (and so can be changed; has methods)
        -> there are other data types
        -> you can make your own datatypes
        -> they are standardised and different types can be useful, depending on context
        -> you can use the abstraction which the datatype allows
