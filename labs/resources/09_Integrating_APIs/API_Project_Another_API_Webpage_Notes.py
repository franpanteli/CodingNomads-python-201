"""API Project Another API Webpage Notes
    -> outline
        -> introduction
        -> possible API ideas
    -> this is in the dungeons_and_dragon_game_4.0_with_APIs directory in the projects folder (of this repository)
        -> this repository > projects > dungeons_and_dragon_game_4.0_with_APIs
    -> we have already put a random name generator into this project
        -> this was done using another API request
    -> this is ideas for other APIs we can add to it
    -> a lot of information is on the internet through free APIs
    -> we can disregard their ideas and use our own
    -> API ideas
        -> weather information
            -> based on the weather of the players
            -> allowing them to find different items in the game based on the weather
            -> we can just get the weather in their location and print it to them
        -> location information
            -> using location information with a real-time weather API
            -> asking the players where they are, then using their response to inclufence gameplay
        -> name meanings
            -> looking up the meaning of their real name and using a modifier, e.g The Brave
        -> word meanings
            -> ALLOWING THE USERS TO FIND INFORMATION WITH STRANGE NAMES
            -> looking up the meaning of these words with the API
        -> recipies
            -> looking up recipies from the food items collected
        -> conversations
            -> showing social media conversations that the players can listen to
        -> translations
            -> give players the choice to read the game instructions in different language
        -> THE EASIEST IS TO PRINT OUT THE WEATHER OF WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE
        -> pick an API that:
            -> is free to use
            -> doesn't require authentication
            -> has nice documentation we can use
        -> we can also use an API which we have previously
            -> printing out a famous quote, or a random image of a dog
            -> either
                -> use the Weather information of where they are
                -> give them a random dog image (here is a picture of the opponent:)
                    -> showing them that they encountered a dog / that their prize is a randmly generated image of
                        the dog
                    -> at this url
                    -> when they win the game, showing them that their prize is a randomly generated image of a dog,
                        collectable at the url - provided that they have internet
            -> implementing the API even if it isn't as straight forward as their ideas
                -> we previously used the Uzby API, to generate a random name for them - of equal length to the
                    one they entered
                -> WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH API KEYS TO GITHUB, THIS IS A SECURITY RISK - THEY SHOULD BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT
                    VARIABLES FOLDER / FILE
                -> they want us to share this on Discord once done
