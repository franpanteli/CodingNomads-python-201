"""What is the Python debugger
    -> outline
        -> introduction
        -> more code, more problems
            -> why use the debugger
    -> we have previously used the print function
        -> this can be used to print the value of variables, at different points in the execution of the code
        -> this is harder to do for larger applications
            -> there are more errors the more code we have
            -> larger programs are more likely to have errors in them
        -> THERE ARE ENTIRE LIBRARIES JUST FOR DEBUGGING THE CODE
    -> breakpoint() <- to add check-in points to the code, to use to inspect the script
