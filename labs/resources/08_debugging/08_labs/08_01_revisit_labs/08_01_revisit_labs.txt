Task:
    Pick at least three labs and do them again while actively using a debugger.

    Revisit the labs that you had a hard time completing.
    Start them over from scratch without looking at the solution.

    Use a visual debugger, such as the one integrated in your IDE or any
    of the other options mentioned in the course to while writing the
    code for these tasks.

    This will give you a chance to revisit challenging tasks, as well as
    to train using your debugger tool.

Notes on task:
    -> we want to pick three labs we have done before, and do them while using a debugger
    -> we can put these in another directory, chock them with breakpoint() function uses
    -> we want to go to three of the harder labs, probably from the previous module
    -> we want to do them from scratch without looking at the solution
    -> suggested debuggers are an integrated one for the IDE
        -> we can also use pdb for this
    -> we are completing three tasks, which we previously did, in a new directory, but using pdb
    -> we want to go to three previously challenging tasks, and do them with the debugger
    -> steps
        -> go through previous tasks and find three ones you found hard
        -> go through and do them again, without looking at the solution
        -> use pdb (the Python debugger), with the breakpoint() function when doing this
    -> three solutions from the previous API exercises were taken, and the breakpoint() function was added into them in multiple places
    -> these were placed into a separate directory (with_breakpoints), and the initial solutions without the use of the breakpoint function were added into the solutions directory 
    -> these use the pdb debugger (Python debugger), which runs in the CLI when the code is executed
