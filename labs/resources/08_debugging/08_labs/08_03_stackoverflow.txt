Notes on task:
    -> we want to go to a certain Stack Overflow page
    -> we want to go through some of the newest options tagged Python
    -> we want to get one of the questions working in the local IDE
        -> this solution has to involve a code snippet
        -> we want a question tagged Python, which involves a code snippet, that is recent
    -> we want to attempt to solve the problem with the IDE
    -> then to post the solution as an answer if we get it
    -> none of the solutions actually contain any code snippets
        -> one is having trouble installing a module / package
