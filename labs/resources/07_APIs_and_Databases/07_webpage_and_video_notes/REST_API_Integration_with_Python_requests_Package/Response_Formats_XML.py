"""Response formats: XML
    -> XML is older than JSON
    -> eXtensible Markup Language
    -> this is older than JSON
    -> it is closer to HTML and more extensive than JSON
    -> it is better to use JSON
    -> PYTHON'S ELEMENT TREE IS USED TO INTERACT WITH XML
    -> example:
        <user>
            <first_name>Carson</first_name>
            <last_name>Boston</last_name>
            <email>carson@boston.com</email>
        </user>
        ->  XML LOOKS LIKE AN HTML FILE
        -> IT IS LESS COMMONLY USED THAN JSON, BUT IS MORE EXTENSIVE
        -> JSON IS A JAVASCRIPT OBJECT
