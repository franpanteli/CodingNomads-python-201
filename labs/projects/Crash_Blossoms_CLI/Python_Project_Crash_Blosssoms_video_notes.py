"""Python Project: Crash Blossoms CLI Video Notes 
    -> expanding the title case function into a CLI program which creates Crash Blossoms 
    -> writing a small program 
    -> collecting user input and returning it to them
    -> he has a dunction defined called titlecase 
        -> it gets passed into the function 
        -> this uses the user input as the input to the function
        -> then prints it out
        -> he modifies the function 
            -> this is done through a while loop
            -> crashblossom is the name of the variable which he has defined
            -> this is the output 
            -> this is the capitalised version of the sentence
            -> it is stored in a variable and printed out to the user
            -> he then goes to the user input, transforms it into titlecase and brings it out to the user again 
    -> he runs the function in the terminal 
        -> it capitalises what the user enters
        -> he fixes the code and runs it again 
        -> this entire project is a video to watch / understand / make notes on  
            -> this is in the fourth module of the course
        -> it returns the input word, capitalised
        -> the purpose of this project is to re-visit functions
            -> they allow us to use user inputs

    In headlines
    Newspaper headlines are written in a telegraphic style (headlinese) which often omits the copula, creating syntactic ambiguity. A common form is the garden path type. The name crash blossoms was proposed for these ambiguous headlines by Danny Bloom in the Testy Copy Editors discussion group in August 2009. He based this on the headline "Violinist (Diana Yukawa) linked to JAL crash blossoms" that Mike O'Connell had posted, asking what such a headline could be called.[8] The Columbia Journalism Review regularly reprints such headlines in its "The Lower Case" column, and has collected them in the anthologies "Squad Helps Dog Bite Victim"[9] and "Red Tape Holds Up New Bridge".[10] Language Log also has an extensive archive of crash blossoms, for example "Infant Pulled from Wrecked Car Involved in Short Police Pursuit".[11]

    Many purported crash blossoms are apocryphal or recycled.[12] One celebrated one from World War I is "French push bottles up German rear";[13] life imitated art in the Second World War headline "Eighth Army Push Bottles Up Germans".[14]
