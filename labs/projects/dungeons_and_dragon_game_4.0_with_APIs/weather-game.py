"""Notes:
    -> this API doesn't work 
    -> instead of this, a dog image generator API was used in the fourth iteration of the project
    -> this means that when the user wins a battle, they will win a prize, which is a randomly generated image of a 
        dog 
    -> this is the same API that was used in the Python_REST_API_Tutorial_(Automation_Tools) project
